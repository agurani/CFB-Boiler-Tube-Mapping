### Circulating Fluidized Bed Boiler (CFB) Furnace Tubes Ultrasonic Thickness Mapping Measurements and Visualization

**This code is for CFB Boiler maintenance team.

CFB Boiler furnace chamber tubes thickness has been checked at different levels on the front wall, rear, right and left walls. Thicknesses have been measured with ultrasonic testing device which has B scanning feature. Measurements are continuously recorded every 1 mm of 1m wall tube length. With Tube thickness less than a specific value is needed to be marked for replacing with proper thickness of tubes.
